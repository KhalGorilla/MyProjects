        <h1 id="rainbowHeader">Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
        <p class="aboutRainbow">Rainbow Six Siege is a complex shooter – perhaps one of the most intricately designed multiplayer games being played right now.
                     The depth comes from numerous places: the destructible environments, the design of the maps, 
                     but primarily from the unique gadgets, stats, and loadouts offered by each of its playable operators.
                    <br><br>
                    Owing to the game’s asymmetric multiplayer gameplay, Rainbow Six Siege operators come in two flavours: attackers and defenders. 
                    Currently, there are 52 Rainbow Six Siege operators to unlock and use in the game, which breaks down neatly into 26 operators for each side. 
                    You will also have to unlock new operators using in-game currency that you can earn through completing matches and ticking off daily challenges, 
                    so it is good to know which ones to snap up first in order to make collecting the remaining operators even faster.
                    <br><br>Here are the best Rainbow Six Siege operators:</p>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;color: aliceblue;">About Each Operator:</h3>
<br>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutHibana">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>HIBANA</bold></span><br>
  Versatility is key to what makes Hibana such an effective breacher. 
  Her gadget, the X-KAIROS, fires six explosive pellets that can 
  blow a small rectangular hole through reinforced surfaces. You get three shots, 
  which means you get the choice of creating either one large entry point that your 
  teammates can walk through, a traversable hole that you can vault through, or a 
  letterbox entry point that you can crawl through. If making an entry point is not 
  necessary, the X-KAIROS can also be used to create sightlines in reinforced walls, 
  which force defenders to reposition themselves or watch both the objective and the 
  newly-created window simultaneously.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutThatcher">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>THATCHER</bold></span><br>
  Entry denial can be a huge problem for attacking teams. 
  It is good to know that Thatcher is the best counter to this type of defensive setup, then. 
  Mute’s signal disruptors and Bandit’s CED-1 Shock Wire render breaching devices, drones, 
  and countless Rainbow Six Siege operator gadgets useless. Likewise, Jäger’s Active Defense System neutralises
  any projectiles that pass by it, which means bombarding the objective with explosives is not an option. 
  Thatcher’s EMP grenades can counter all of these devices, even through walls and ceilings. 
  Naturally, this makes Thatcher one of the most important Rainbow Six Siege operators on attack.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutAsh">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Ash</bold></span><br>
  Ash has been a staple pick for skilled players since Rainbow Six Siege 
  launched, and she continues to be one of the most popular, versatile, 
  and deadly Rainbow Six Siege operators in the game. The reason for this 
  is speed – Ash is one of a select few three-speed attackers. 
  This makes her adept at rushing the objective and catching the 
  defending side off guard while they are still setting up gadgets 
  and reinforcing walls. Her M120 Crem, which comes with two Breaching 
  Rounds, makes short work of doorways and unreinforced walls so you 
  can burst through the defender’s site within a few seconds of the 
  round starting.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutBuck">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Buck</bold></span><br>
  As attacking strategies have got ever more complex, Buck has found his 
  place in the meta, not as the entry fragger as his loadout suggests,
   but as one of the best Rainbow Six Siege operators for vertical play. 
   Buck is able to open up floors and ceilings with devastating efficiency 
   with his underslung shotgun, which lends him the ability to lock down 
   the objective from unexpected angles.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutThermite">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Thermite</bold></span><br>
  Less popular than Hibana but still very much a part of the meta, 
  Thermite is all about total destruction of reinforced walls – nothing less will do.
   Better yet, you can run both Hibana and Thermite in the same team to 
   make certain no enemy wall is left standing.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators1" id="aboutMaverick">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Maverick</bold></span><br>
  With Thatcher routinely being banned to stop hard breachers, 
  Maverick is the ideal candidate to support the team. His blowtorch gadget
   can quietly burn holes and lines in both soft and reinforced walls, 
   allowing you to either create small holes to crawl through, large new 
   lines of sight, or tiny peek holes.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutSmoke">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Smoke</bold></span><br>
  When it comes to defensive Rainbow Six Siege operators, 
  there are two distinct roles: roamers and anchors. Smoke
   is the ideal anchor, an operator who excels at holding
    down the objective room and denying defuser plants with 
    his Remote Gas Grenades, which can block off corridors 
    for ten seconds at a time with damaging fumes.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutEcho">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Echo</bold></span><br>
  It took a long time for players to figure out what role the 
  Japanese defender is best at, but after a year of balancing 
  tweaks Echo is among the best Rainbow Six Siege defenders in 
  the game. It all comes down to his Yokai drone and its power 
  to disrupt attackers as halfway through planting the defuser. 
  One well-timed blast from a Yokai can throw an entire attacking 
  strategy into disarray as smoke grenades wear off and roaming 
  defenders get time to rotate and pounce on their prey.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutBandit">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Bandit</bold></span><br>
  While Mute is an exceptionally capable counter to Thermite and 
  Hibana, Bandit’s ability to actually destroy the gadgets of 
  enemy Rainbow Six Siege operators makes him the more effective 
  of the two operators when it comes to denying breachers. 
  Thanks to tactics like Bandit-tricking – waiting for 
  Thermite to place his charge and using the sound cue to 
  figure out where the Exothermic Charge is before placing 
  the Shock Wire and destroying it – a skilled Bandit can completely
   deny a Thermite and Thatcher attack.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutJager">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Jager</bold></span><br>
  Grenades are particularly lethal in Siege thanks to the game
   being set in a series of interconnected rooms. It is hard to 
   escape confined, shrapnel-friendly areas in a hurry, which is 
   where Jäger comes in handy. His Active Defense System gadget can 
   detect, track, and disarm. And since the system is automated, Jäger 
   can be off roaming and killing attackers – no need to babysit them.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutMozzie">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Mozzie</bold></span><br>
  Mozzie has quickly become one of the most underappreciated defenders 
  in Rainbow Six Siege. Both of his primary weapons are among the best 
  weapons in the game, he offers utility in the form of a nitro cell 
  and secondary shotgun, and he not only limits the attacking team’s 
  intelligence gathering, but instead directly counters it by adding 
  enemy drones to the defender’s surveillance network.
</p>
<p class="aboutOperators2" id="aboutMaestro">
  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><bold>Maestro</bold></span><br>
  Maestro is never essential, but his primary weapon, an LMG with an ACOG 
  is totally unique among defenders, making him incredibly useful when it
  comes to holding down sites. Playing around tight angles with the LMG is 
  lethal, and if you take miss with your first burst you should have a spare 
  90 rounds to make something happen before you need to reload. His two Evil
  Eye cameras don’t offer much in terms of fragging or dissuading attackers, 
  but as they can see through smoke and are bulletproof, they’re great for getting 
  information on when the attackers are pushing and planting.
